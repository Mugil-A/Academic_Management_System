The Academic Management System is a SQL-based project designed to help manage student information and course enrollments. It uses three tables—StudentInfo, CoursesInfo, and EnrollmentInfo—to store student details, course data, and enrollment records. The system allows adding, updating, and tracking students and their courses efficiently, making academic data organized, easy to access, and simple to manage.
